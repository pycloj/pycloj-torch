(ns torch.distributions.transformed-distribution.Transform
  "
    Abstract class for invertable transformations with computable log
    det jacobians. They are primarily used in
    :class:`torch.distributions.TransformedDistribution`.

    Caching is useful for tranforms whose inverses are either expensive or
    numerically unstable. Note that care must be taken with memoized values
    since the autograd graph may be reversed. For example while the following
    works with or without caching::

        y = t(x)
        t.log_abs_det_jacobian(x, y).backward()  # x will receive gradients.

    However the following will error when caching due to dependency reversal::

        y = t(x)
        z = t.inv(y)
        grad(z.sum(), [y])  # error because z is x

    Derived classes should implement one or both of :meth:`_call` or
    :meth:`_inverse`. Derived classes that set `bijective=True` should also
    implement :meth:`log_abs_det_jacobian`.

    Args:
        cache_size (int): Size of cache. If zero, no caching is done. If one,
            the latest single value is cached. Only 0 and 1 are supported.

    Attributes:
        domain (:class:`~torch.distributions.constraints.Constraint`):
            The constraint representing valid inputs to this transform.
        codomain (:class:`~torch.distributions.constraints.Constraint`):
            The constraint representing valid outputs to this transform
            which are inputs to the inverse transform.
        bijective (bool): Whether this transform is bijective. A transform
            ``t`` is bijective iff ``t.inv(t(x)) == x`` and
            ``t(t.inv(y)) == y`` for every ``x`` in the domain and ``y`` in
            the codomain. Transforms that are not bijective should at least
            maintain the weaker pseudoinverse properties
            ``t(t.inv(t(x)) == t(x)`` and ``t.inv(t(t.inv(y))) == t.inv(y)``.
        sign (int or Tensor): For bijective univariate transforms, this
            should be +1 or -1 depending on whether transform is monotone
            increasing or decreasing.
        event_dim (int): Number of dimensions that are correlated together in
            the transform ``event_shape``. This should be 0 for pointwise
            transforms, 1 for transforms that act jointly on vectors, 2 for
            transforms that act jointly on matrices, etc.
