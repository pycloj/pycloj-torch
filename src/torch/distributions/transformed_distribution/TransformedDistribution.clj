(ns torch.distributions.transformed-distribution.TransformedDistribution
  "
    Extension of the Distribution class, which applies a sequence of Transforms
    to a base distribution.  Let f be the composition of transforms applied::

        X ~ BaseDistribution
        Y = f(X) ~ TransformedDistribution(BaseDistribution, f)
        log p(Y) = log p(X) + log |det (dX/dY)|

    Note that the ``.event_shape`` of a :class:`TransformedDistribution` is the
    maximum shape of its base distribution and its transforms, since transforms
    can introduce correlations among events.

    An example for the usage of :class:`TransformedDistribution` would be::

        # Building a Logistic Distribution
        # X ~ Uniform(0, 1)
        # f = a + b * logit(X)
        # Y ~ f(X) ~ Logistic(a, b)
        base_distribution = Uniform(0, 1)
        transforms = [SigmoidTransform().inv, AffineTransform(loc=a, scale=b)]
        logistic = TransformedDistribution(base_distribution, transforms)

        Note that this enumerates over all batched tensors in lock-step
        `[[0, 0], [1, 1], ...]`. With `expand=False`, enumeration happens
        along dim 0, but with the remaining batch dimensions being
        singleton dimensions, `[[0], [1], ..`.

        To iterate over the full Cartesian product use
        `itertools.product(m.enumerate_support())`.

        Args:
            expand (bool): whether to expand the support over the
                batch dims to match the distribution's `batch_shape`.
