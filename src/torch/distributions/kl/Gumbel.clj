(defn enumerate-support 
  "
        Returns tensor containing all values supported by a discrete
        distribution. The result will enumerate over dimension 0, so the shape
        of the result will be `(cardinality,) + batch_shape + event_shape`
        (where `event_shape = ()` for univariate distributions).

        Note that this enumerates over all batched tensors in lock-step
        `[[0, 0], [1, 1], ...]`. With `expand=False`, enumeration happens
        along dim 0, but with the remaining batch dimensions being
        singleton dimensions, `[[0], [1], ..`.

        To iterate over the full Cartesian product use
        `itertools.product(m.enumerate_support())`.

        Args:
            expand (bool): whether to expand the support over the
                batch dims to match the distribution's `batch_shape`.
