(ns torch.distributions.multinomial.Categorical
  "
    Creates a categorical distribution parameterized by either :attr:`probs` or
    :attr:`logits` (but not both).

    .. note::
        It is equivalent to the distribution that :func:`torch.multinomial`
        samples from.

    Samples are integers from :math:`\{0, \ldots, K-1\}` where `K` is ``probs.size(-1)``.

    If :attr:`probs` is 1D with length-`K`, each element is the relative
    probability of sampling the class at that index.

    If :attr:`probs` is 2D, it is treated as a batch of relative probability
    vectors.

    .. note:: :attr:`probs` must be non-negative, finite and have a non-zero sum,
              and it will be normalized to sum to 1.

    See also: :func:`torch.multinomial`

    Example::

        >>> m = Categorical(torch.tensor([ 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25 ]))
        >>> m.sample()  # equal probability of 0, 1, 2, 3
        tensor(3)

    Args:
        probs (Tensor): event probabilities
        logits (Tensor): event log-odds
