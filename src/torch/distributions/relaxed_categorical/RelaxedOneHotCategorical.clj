(ns torch.distributions.relaxed-categorical.RelaxedOneHotCategorical
  "
    Creates a RelaxedOneHotCategorical distribution parametrized by
    :attr:`temperature`, and either :attr:`probs` or :attr:`logits`.
    This is a relaxed version of the :class:`OneHotCategorical` distribution, so
    its samples are on simplex, and are reparametrizable.

    Example::

        >>> m = RelaxedOneHotCategorical(torch.tensor([2.2]),
                                         torch.tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]))
        >>> m.sample()
        tensor([ 0.1294,  0.2324,  0.3859,  0.2523])

    Args:
        temperature (Tensor): relaxation temperature
        probs (Tensor): event probabilities
        logits (Tensor): the log probability of each event.

        Note that this enumerates over all batched tensors in lock-step
        `[[0, 0], [1, 1], ...]`. With `expand=False`, enumeration happens
        along dim 0, but with the remaining batch dimensions being
        singleton dimensions, `[[0], [1], ..`.

        To iterate over the full Cartesian product use
        `itertools.product(m.enumerate_support())`.
