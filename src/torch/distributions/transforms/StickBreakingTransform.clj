(ns torch.distributions.transforms.StickBreakingTransform
  "
    Transform from unconstrained space to the simplex of one additional
    dimension via a stick-breaking process.

    This transform arises as an iterated sigmoid transform in a stick-breaking
    construction of the `Dirichlet` distribution: the first logit is
    transformed via sigmoid to the first probability and the probability of
    everything else, and then the process recurses.

    This is bijective and appropriate for use in HMC; however it mixes
    coordinates together and is less appropriate for optimization.
