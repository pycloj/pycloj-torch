(ns torch.distributions.relaxed-bernoulli.RelaxedBernoulli
  "
    Creates a RelaxedBernoulli distribution, parametrized by
    :attr:`temperature`, and either :attr:`probs` or :attr:`logits`
    (but not both). This is a relaxed version of the `Bernoulli` distribution,
    so the values are in (0, 1), and has reparametrizable samples.

    Example::

        >>> m = RelaxedBernoulli(torch.tensor([2.2]),
                                 torch.tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.99]))
        >>> m.sample()
        tensor([ 0.2951,  0.3442,  0.8918,  0.9021])

    Args:
        temperature (Tensor): relaxation temperature
        probs (Number, Tensor): the probability of sampling `1`
        logits (Number, Tensor): the log-odds of sampling `1`

        Note that this enumerates over all batched tensors in lock-step
        `[[0, 0], [1, 1], ...]`. With `expand=False`, enumeration happens
        along dim 0, but with the remaining batch dimensions being
        singleton dimensions, `[[0], [1], ..`.

        To iterate over the full Cartesian product use
        `itertools.product(m.enumerate_support())`.
