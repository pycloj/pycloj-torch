(ns torch.distributions.Geometric
  "
    Creates a Geometric distribution parameterized by :attr:`probs`,
    where :attr:`probs` is the probability of success of Bernoulli trials.
    It represents the probability that in :math:`k + 1` Bernoulli trials, the
    first :math:`k` trials failed, before seeing a success.

    Samples are non-negative integers [0, :math:`\inf`).

    Example::

        >>> m = Geometric(torch.tensor([0.3]))
        >>> m.sample()  # underlying Bernoulli has 30% chance 1; 70% chance 0
        tensor([ 2.])

    Args:
        probs (Number, Tensor): the probability of sampling `1`. Must be in range (0, 1]
        logits (Number, Tensor): the log-odds of sampling `1`.

  "
        Returns tensor containing all values supported by a discrete

        of the result will be `(cardinality,) + batch_shape + event_shape`
        (where `event_shape = ()` for univariate distributions).

        Note that this enumerates over all batched tensors in lock-step
        `[[0, 0], [1, 1], ...]`. With `expand=False`, enumeration happens
        along dim 0, but with the remaining batch dimensions being
        singleton dimensions, `[[0], [1], ..`.

        To iterate over the full Cartesian product use
        `itertools.product(m.enumerate_support())`.

        Args:
            expand (bool): whether to expand the support over the
                batch dims to match the distribution's `batch_shape`.
