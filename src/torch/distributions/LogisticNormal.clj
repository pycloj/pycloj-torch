(ns torch.distributions.LogisticNormal
  "
    Creates a logistic-normal distribution parameterized by :attr:`loc` and :attr:`scale`
    that define the base `Normal` distribution transformed with the
    `StickBreakingTransform` such that::

        X ~ LogisticNormal(loc, scale)
        Y = log(X / (1 - X.cumsum(-1)))[..., :-1] ~ Normal(loc, scale)

    Args:
        loc (float or Tensor): mean of the base distribution
        scale (float or Tensor): standard deviation of the base distribution

    Example::

        >>> # logistic-normal distributed with mean=(0, 0, 0) and stddev=(1, 1, 1)
        >>> # of the base Normal distribution
        >>> m = distributions.LogisticNormal(torch.tensor([0.0] * 3), torch.tensor([1.0] * 3))
        >>> m.sample()
        tensor([ 0.7653,  0.0341,  0.0579,  0.1427])

        Note that this enumerates over all batched tensors in lock-step
        `[[0, 0], [1, 1], ...]`. With `expand=False`, enumeration happens
        along dim 0, but with the remaining batch dimensions being
        singleton dimensions, `[[0], [1], ..`.

        To iterate over the full Cartesian product use
        `itertools.product(m.enumerate_support())`.
