(ns torch.autograd.profiler.emit-nvtx
  "Context manager that makes every autograd operation emit an NVTX range.

    It is useful when running the program under nvprof::

        nvprof --profile-from-start off -o trace_name.prof -- <regular command here>

    Unfortunately, there's no way to force nvprof to flush the data it collected
    to disk, so for CUDA profiling one has to use this context manager to annotate
    nvprof traces and wait for the process to exit before inspecting them.
    Then, either NVIDIA Visual Profiler (nvvp) can be used to visualize the timeline, or
    :func:`torch.autograd.profiler.load_nvprof` can load the results for inspection
    e.g. in Python REPL.

    .. warning:
        This context manager should not be called recursively, i.e. at most one
        instance should be enabled at any given time.

    Arguments:
        enabled (bool, optional, default=True): Setting ``enabled=False`` makes this context manager a no-op.
            Default: ``True``.
        record_shapes (bool, optional, default=False): If ``record_shapes=True``, the nvtx range wrapping
            each autograd op will append information about the sizes of Tensor arguments received
            by that op, in the following format:
            ``[[arg0.size(0), arg0.size(1), ...], [arg1.size(0), arg1.size(1), ...], ...]``
            Non-tensor arguments will be represented by ``[]``.
            Arguments will be listed in the order they are received by the backend op.
            Please note that this order may not match the order in which those arguments were passed
            on the Python side.  Also note that shape recording may increase the overhead of nvtx range creation.

    Example:
        >>> with torch.cuda.profiler.profile():
        ...     model(x) # Warmup CUDA memory allocator and profiler
        ...     with torch.autograd.profiler.emit_nvtx():
        ...         model(x)

    **Forward-backward correlation**

    When viewing a profile created using :class:`emit_nvtx` in the Nvidia Visual Profiler,
    correlating each backward-pass op with the corresponding forward-pass op can be difficult.
    To ease this task, :class:`emit_nvtx` appends sequence number information to the ranges it
    generates.

    During the forward pass, each function range is decorated with ``seq=<N>``.  ``seq`` is a running
    counter, incremented each time a new backward Function object is created and stashed for backward.
    Thus, the ``seq=<N>`` annotation associated with each forward function range tells you that
    if a backward Function object is created by this forward function,
    the backward object will receive sequence number N.
    During the backward pass, the top-level range wrapping each C++ backward Function's
    ``apply()`` call is decorated with ``stashed seq=<M>``.  ``M`` is the sequence number that
    the backward object was created with.  By comparing ``stashed seq`` numbers in backward with ``seq``
    numbers in forward, you can track down which forward op created each backward Function.

    Any functions executed during the backward pass are also decorated with ``seq=<N>``.  During
    default backward (with ``create_graph=False``) this information is irrelevant, and in fact,
    ``N`` may simply be 0 for all such functions.  Only the top-level ranges associated with
    backward Function objects' ``apply()`` methods are useful, as a way to correlate these Function
    objects with the earlier forward pass.

    **Double-backward**

    If, on the other hand, a backward pass with ``create_graph=True`` is underway (in other words,
    if you are setting up for a double-backward), each function's execution during backward
    is given a nonzero, useful ``seq=<N>``.  Those functions may themselves create Function objects
    to be executed later during double-backward, just as the original functions in the forward pass did.
    The relationship between backward and double-backward is conceptually the same as the relationship
    between forward and backward: The functions still emit current-sequence-number-tagged ranges,
    the Function objects they create still stash those sequence numbers, and during the eventual
    double-backward, the Function objects' ``apply()`` ranges are still tagged with ``stashed seq``
    numbers, which can be compared to `seq` numbers from the backward pass.

    .. warning:
        The sequence number is thread-local, and some forward functions don't create an associated
        backward Function object (instead delegating that to sub-functions further down the call chain).
        For these reasons, the correspondence of stashed sequence numbers in
        backward Function ``apply()`` ranges with `seq` numbers in forward-pass ranges is
        not guaranteed to be 1 to 1.  The sequence numbers alone may not be enough to fully
        disambiguate which forward function created which
        backward Function object.  You may need to make a judgment based on analytic knowledge of what
        the expected correspondence should be.
