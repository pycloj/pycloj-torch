(defn pack-padded-sequence 
  "Packs a Tensor containing padded sequences of variable length.

    :attr:`input` can be of size ``T x B x *`` where `T` is the length of the
    longest sequence (equal to ``lengths[0]``), ``B`` is the batch size, and
    ``*`` is any number of dimensions (including 0). If ``batch_first`` is
    ``True``, ``B x T x *`` :attr:`input` is expected.

    For unsorted sequences, use `enforce_sorted = False`. If :attr:`enforce_sorted` is
    ``True``, the sequences should be sorted by length in a decreasing order, i.e.
    ``input[:,0]`` should be the longest sequence, and ``input[:,B-1]`` the shortest
    one. `enforce_sorted = True` is only necessary for ONNX export.

    Note:
        This function accepts any input that has at least two dimensions. You
        can apply it to pack the labels, and use the output of the RNN with
        them to compute the loss directly. A Tensor can be retrieved from
        a :class:`PackedSequence` object by accessing its ``.data`` attribute.

    Arguments:
        input (Tensor): padded batch of variable length sequences.
        lengths (Tensor): list of sequences lengths of each batch element.
        batch_first (bool, optional): if ``True``, the input is expected in ``B x T x *``
            format.
        enforce_sorted (bool, optional): if ``True``, the input is expected to
            contain sequences sorted by length in a decreasing order. If
            ``False``, this condition is not checked. Default: ``True``.

    ``sequences`` should be a list of Tensors of size ``L x *``, where `L` is
    the length of a sequence and `*` is any number of trailing dimensions,

    For unsorted sequences, use `enforce_sorted = False`. If ``enforce_sorted``

(defn pad-packed-sequence 
  "Pads a packed batch of variable length sequences.

    It is an inverse operation to :func:`pack_padded_sequence`.

    The returned Tensor's data will be of size ``T x B x *``, where `T` is the length
    of the longest sequence and `B` is the batch size. If ``batch_first`` is True,
    the data will be transposed into ``B x T x *`` format.

    Batch elements will be ordered decreasingly by their length.

    .. note::
        :attr:`total_length` is useful to implement the
        ``pack sequence -> recurrent network -> unpack sequence`` pattern in a
        :class:`~torch.nn.Module` wrapped in :class:`~torch.nn.DataParallel`.
        See :ref:`this FAQ section <pack-rnn-unpack-with-data-parallelism>` for
        details.

    Arguments:
        sequence (PackedSequence): batch to pad
        batch_first (bool, optional): if ``True``, the output will be in ``B x T x *``
            format.
        padding_value (float, optional): values for padded elements.
        total_length (int, optional): if not ``None``, the output will be padded to
            have length :attr:`total_length`. This method will throw :class:`ValueError`
            if :attr:`total_length` is less than the max sequence length in
            :attr:`sequence`.

    Returns:

(defn pad-sequence 
  "Pad a list of variable length Tensors with ``padding_value``

    ``pad_sequence`` stacks a list of Tensors along a new dimension,
    and pads them to equal length. For example, if the input is list of
    sequences with size ``L x *`` and if batch_first is False, and ``T x B x *``
    otherwise.

    `B` is batch size. It is equal to the number of elements in ``sequences``.
    `T` is length of the longest sequence.
    `L` is length of the sequence.
    `*` is any number of trailing dimensions, including none.

    Example:

    Note:
        This function returns a Tensor of size ``T x B x *`` or ``B x T x *``
        where `T` is the length of the longest sequence. This function assumes
        trailing dimensions and type of all the Tensors in sequences are same.

    Arguments:
        sequences (list[Tensor]): list of variable length sequences.
        batch_first (bool, optional): output will be in ``B x T x *`` if True, or in
            ``T x B x *`` otherwise
        padding_value (float, optional): value for padded elements. Default: 0.
